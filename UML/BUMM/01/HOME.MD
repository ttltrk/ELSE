UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of 
software systems. UML was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) and UML 1.0 specification draft was proposed to the OMG in January 
1997. It was initially started to capture the behavior of complex software and non-software system and now it has become an OMG standard. 
This tutorial gives a complete understanding on UML.
