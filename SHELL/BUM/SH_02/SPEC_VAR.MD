SPECIAL VARIABLES

|Var | Desc|
|--------------|-----------------|
|```$0```|The filename of the current script.|
|```$n```|These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here n is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is ```$1```, the second argument is ```$2```, and so on).|
|```$#```|The number of arguments supplied to a script.|
|```$*```|All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, ```$*``` is equivalent to ```$1 $2```.
|```$@```|All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, ```$@``` is equivalent to ```$1 $2```.|
|```$?```|The exit status of the last command executed.|
|```$$```|The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.|
|```$!```|The process number of the last background command.|
